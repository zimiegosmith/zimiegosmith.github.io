During the tenth week, my group and I presented our final report. We were able to make so much progress and we all were happy with the accomplishments we made for this summer. We also presented a poster of our results at a symposium held at Morgan where we were also very happy about the questions we were asked. This summer program was great and I was able to network with people who I will keep in contact with in the future.
