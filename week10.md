During the eighth week, my group and I made progress on our final report. We could also validate our model and compare our model with other machine-learning results. We were able to create our Elevator pitch for our project. I had the chance to learn more about neural networks specifically artificial and convolutional neural networks. Then I was able to improve my professional writing skills with the help of my mentor.
