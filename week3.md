During the third week, I practiced implementing different Python libraries for data analysis (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib), Plotted aerosol data using Matplotlib, and examined research articles and papers to develop my professional writing abilities and be more cohesive when it comes to writing. Overall I was able to research background information about machine learning algorithms and models specifically two supervised learning models: Random forest and linear regression. Outside of being in the lab, we were able to use ground stations to acquire AOD data which consisted of a weather balloon and a drone. We also went on a Johns Hopkins Applied Physics lab tour
