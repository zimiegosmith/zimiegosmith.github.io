During the seventh week, my group and I presented our mid-summer presentation for the symposium. We successfully presented our findings and we received very helpful feedback. We were also able to listen to other groups' presentations and see their progress throughout the program. I enjoyed the process of putting together the presentation. This week I was also taught how to break down the literature reviews that we were tasked with reading.
