During the fifth week, my group and I presented our project to high school students. We taught them the importance of machine learning and aerosols known as PM 2.5. We also practiced using Random Forest to look at which features were most important in predicting the concentration of PM 2.5. My group and I started brainstorming ideas to write our papers to present at a conference as well as develop our professional writing skills. We developed regression metric skills to ensure we can evaluate the data we simulated using Random Forest.
