During the first week, I met with Dr. Li and my mentors to discuss the project 
that I will be working on. I was introduced to aerosols and what Dr. Li will be looking for in our project and for the summer. 
I also toured the labs for the summer and got to see what we would be looking at regarding our research. I also better understood Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Github. I got a refresher on Python syntax and general basics that I hadn't done in a while.
