During the fourth week, I attended a NASA tour at the Goddard location. I got to see how NASA is implementing different technologies and gained more insight into how they observe different aerosols in the atmosphere. It was very interesting because the topics discussed related to my project which is the monitoring of aerosols. I was also introduced to my groups high school teacher mentor and got an insight about his role in the summer program.
