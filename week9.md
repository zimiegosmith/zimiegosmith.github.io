During the ninth week, my group and I finished our final presentation. We also had guest speakers from the NSA come and talk to us about AI ethics and how they combat different threats posed by advanced technological systems. Additionally I was able to learn more about artificial neural networks to implement in the retrieval of PM 2.5 from Satellite AOD.
