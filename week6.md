During the sixth week, my group and I prepared our mid-summer presentation for the symposium. We learned how to construct our presentation and reduce the amount of information we have on our slides. I also figured out how to divide my preliminary literature reviews into three main categories: The name of the papers, their key findings, the gaps, and how to address them. I also collected data from the NASA Giovanni site to help look at the parameters for our project.
