## About My Project

mBot Neo

Problem: Aerosols play an important role in the earth's radiation budget. They affect our climate, and air quality, and cause several respiratory issues. ​Aerosols can be monitored in terms of AOD(Aerosol optical depth) and PM2.5 using ground and satellite stations. ​Ground stations are very few and expensive. ​

Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in designing a system that accomplishes the following:

  - Using machine learning we can estimate PM2.5 from satellite AOD data focusing on the Baltimore/Washington area​
  - Process raw sensor data and classify events such as gestures (e.g., arm movements) and emotional states (e.g., attention levels)
  - Map output from physiological sensors to a physical robot. 

Expected Outcome: The project is expected to result in a conference poster presentation at the end of the CEAMLS program. The poster will focus on producing an open-access, and user-friendly database of both aerosol optical depths and PM2.5 surface concentrations, focusing on the Baltimore-Washington area.
